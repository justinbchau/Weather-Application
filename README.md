# Weather App
 
[Check out the App here](https://mrchaufun.github.io/Weather-Application/)

Allow the application to view your location, otherwise it will throw an error. 

I used the DarkSky API along with Skycons to display the current weather. 

This was also created using only vanilla JavaScript
